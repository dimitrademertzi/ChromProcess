Reaction samples (35 μL) were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and freeze-dried
overnight to give dry to oily residues. To each sample was added a solution of
O-ethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride in pyridine (75 μL, 20 g L^−1^). A solution
of dodecane and tetradecane (100 μL, 1.6 mM each in pyridine) was then added to
each sample. The samples were then shaken at 70 °C for 30 minutes. After
cooling to room temperature, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (25 μL)
was added to each sample. The samples were again shaken at 70 °C for 30
minutes. The samples were then cooled to room temperature, followed by
centrifugation (3-5 min, 10,000 rpm). The supernatants were decanted into
sample vials for analysis by GC-MS.
